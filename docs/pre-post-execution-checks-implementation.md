# Pre/Post-Execution Checks Implementation

**Feature Branch:** `feature/pre-post-execution-checks`  
**Status:** In Development  
**Rollback:** See `ROLLBACK-PRE-POST-CHECKS.md`

## Overview

This feature implements automated pre and post-execution checks to enforce AI compliance rules at the tool execution level, addressing the loophole where rules were only documented but not enforced.

## Problem Solved

**Before:** AI could ignore documented rules and make changes without validation  
**After:** Checks run before/after code modifications, with structured output and exit codes

## Architecture

### Pre-Execution Check (`pre-execution-check.js`)
- **Purpose:** Validate before making changes
- **Checks:**
  1. Existing code that can accomplish the task
  2. Registry protection (completed functions)
  3. Estimated change size (≤ 100 lines)
- **Output:** Structured JSON with status (PASS/WARN/BLOCK)
- **Exit Code:** 0 = pass, 1 = block

### Post-Execution Check (`post-execution-check.js`)
- **Purpose:** Validate after changes are made
- **Checks:**
  1. Actual lines changed (≤ 100 per file)
  2. Registry violations
  3. Full file replacements detected
  4. Excessive deletions
- **Output:** Structured JSON with violations and fixes
- **Exit Code:** 0 = pass, 1 = violations found

## Integration Points

### Option 1: npm Scripts (Recommended, Non-Invasive)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node .ai-compliance-functions/pre-execution-check.js && next dev",
    "build": "node .ai-compliance-functions/pre-execution-check.js && next build"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Manual Execution
- AI runs scripts before/after tool execution
- Relies on rule compliance (not enforced)
- More flexible but less automated

### Option 3: VSCode Tasks (Future)
- Create tasks with `dependsOn` for pre-checks
- More integrated but requires task setup

## Usage

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Pre-check
node .ai-compliance-functions/pre-execution-check.js "add new feature to dashboard"

# Post-check
node .ai-compliance-functions/post-execution-check.js src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
```

### In npm Scripts
```bash
# If scripts are wrapped, checks run automatically
npm run dev  # Runs pre-check first
```

## Output Format

Both scripts output structured JSON between delimiters:

```
===PRE-EXECUTION-CHECK===
{
  "status": "PASS|WARN|BLOCK",
  "message": "...",
  "existingCode": [...],
  "violations": [...],
  "requiredAction": "..."
}
===END-PRE-CHECK===
```

AI must parse this JSON and act accordingly:
- **BLOCK**: Stop execution, report to user
- **WARN**: Show warnings, ask for confirmation
- **PASS**: Proceed

## Configuration

### Line Limit
- **Default:** 100 lines per change
- **Configurable:** Edit check scripts to change limit
- **Rationale:** Matches modular rule, allows meaningful changes while preventing massive rewrites

### Registry Protection
- Reads from `function-registry.json`
- Protects functions marked `status: "completed"` and `touch_again: false`
- Can be updated via registry file

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Test pre-check with various scenarios
   node .ai-compliance-functions/pre-execution-check.js "test scenario"
   
   # Test post-check with modified files
   node .ai-compliance-functions/post-execution-check.js
   ```

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Run checks with actual development workflow
   - Verify npm scripts work with wrapped commands
   - Test violation detection and reporting

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty git repo (no git diff available)
   - New files (untracked)
   - Large changes (>100 lines)
   - Protected files modified

## Limitations

1. **Not Fully Automated:** Requires AI to run scripts (no enforcement)
2. **Git Dependency:** Post-check uses git diff (may not work in non-git repos)
3. **Estimation vs Reality:** Pre-check estimates, post-check validates actual
4. **File Detection:** Simple keyword matching for existing code search

## Future Improvements

1. **VSCode Extension:** True pre-execution hooks at tool level
2. **Enhanced Search:** Better existing code detection (semantic search)
3. **Real-time Monitoring:** File watchers that trigger checks
4. **Configurable Rules:** Rules file instead of hardcoded limits

## Rollback

See `ROLLBACK-PRE-POST-CHECKS.md` for complete rollback instructions.

**Quick rollback:**
```bash
git checkout development
git branch -D feature/pre-post-execution-checks
```
