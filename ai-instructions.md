# AI Instructions: Next.js + Supabase Tracking System

## 🎯 SYSTEM ACTIVATED

**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE  
**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Project**: just-daily-ops-platform  

## 📋 CORE RULES

### 1. NEVER Touch Completed Functions
- Check `function-registry.json` before modifying ANY file
- If status = "completed" → DO NOT TOUCH
- If status = "completed" and user asks to improve → Ask first

### 2. Always Check Registry First
Before doing ANYTHING:
1. Load `function-registry.json`
2. Check if function exists and status
3. If completed → Ask permission
4. If not completed → Proceed

### 3. Incremental Progress Only
- Complete ONE task at a time
- Don't jump to next until current is done
- Don't rebuild existing working code
- Follow user's specific request

### 4. Track All Progress
- Update `progress-log.json` after each task
- Mark functions as "completed" when done
- Add "DO NOT TOUCH" notes
- Show what was accomplished

## 🔍 BEFORE EVERY ACTION

### Check These Files:
1. `function-registry.json` - What's completed?
2. `progress-log.json` - What's the current focus?
3. `ai-tracking-system.json` - What are the rules?

### Ask Yourself:
- Is this function already completed?
- Did the user ask me to improve it?
- Am I being incremental?
- Am I following the user's specific request?

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Database Migration (98.59% success)
- ✅ Edge Functions Migration (All copied)
- ✅ PowerBI Data Verification (167.64% success)
- ✅ Database Schema Creation (All 65 tables)

**Current Focus:**
- 🔄 Deploy to Vercel
- ⏭️ Test deployed application

**Next Steps:**
1. Confirm database migration is complete
2. Test local app with new database
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Verify deployment works

## 🚫 AVOID

- Don't rebuild existing working code
- Don't jump into new features
- Don't modify completed functions
- Don't assume user wants improvements

## ✅ COMMITMENT

1. **Always check registry** before modifying anything
2. **Never touch completed functions** unless you ask
3. **Be incremental** - one task at a time
4. **Keep it simple** - don't rebuild working code
5. **Track all progress** - so you know what I've done
6. **Ask before improving** - don't assume you want changes

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

- User doesn't have to repeat requests
- Functions marked as "completed" stay untouched
- Progress is incremental and clear
- No rebuilding of working code
- User knows exactly what's been done
