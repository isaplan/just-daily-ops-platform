# AI OPERATING CONSTRAINTS - UNBREAKABLE RULES

## 🚀 **AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE SETUP**

### **📋 Quick Setup (Copy & Paste)**
```bash
# 1. Copy ONLY this file to your project root:
# - .ai-rules-docs/ai-operating-constraints.md

# 2. Run the self-installer (generates everything else):
node .ai-rules-docs/ai-compliance-installer.js

# 3. Start automated compliance monitoring:
npm run compliance:auto
```

### **🚀 Self-Installer Features**
The `ai-compliance-installer.js` automatically creates:
- ✅ `.ai-compliance-functions/` folder with all compliance tools
- ✅ `function-registry.json` - Tracks completed functions
- ✅ `progress-log.json` - Tracks development progress
- ✅ `ai-tracking-system.json` - Tracks compliance status
- ✅ NPM scripts for easy compliance management
- ✅ Tests the system to ensure everything works

### **🔧 Manual Setup (Alternative)**
```bash
# 1. Copy these files to your project root:
# - .ai-rules-docs/ai-operating-constraints.md
# - .ai-compliance-functions/ (entire folder)
# - function-registry.json
# - progress-log.json
# - ai-tracking-system.json

# 2. Add to package.json scripts:
npm pkg set scripts.compliance:check="node .ai-compliance-functions/ai-compliance-checker.js"
npm pkg set scripts.compliance:auto="node .ai-compliance-functions/auto-compliance.js"
npm pkg set scripts.compliance:dashboard="node .ai-compliance-functions/ai-compliance-dashboard.js"

# 3. Start automated compliance monitoring:
npm run compliance:auto
```

### **🔧 Automated Compliance Features**
- **File Watchers** - Automatically checks compliance when files change
- **Periodic Checks** - Runs every 5 minutes automatically
- **Auto-Updates** - Updates tracking system every minute
- **Violation Prevention** - Blocks rule violations before they happen
- **Progress Tracking** - Automatically tracks all development progress

### **📊 Compliance Commands**
- `npm run compliance:check` - Manual compliance check
- `npm run compliance:auto` - Start automated monitoring (recommended)
- `npm run compliance:dashboard` - View compliance dashboard

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Start Auto Compliance**
**Before starting any development work, ALWAYS run:**
```bash
npm run compliance:auto
```
This prevents AI from violating rules and destroying working code.

## 🛡️ **UNBREAKABLE GUARD RAILS SYSTEM**

### **🔒 CORE DIRECTIVES**
- **DEFENSIVE MODE ONLY** - No other modes allowed
- **NO OVERRIDES** - No @override, @free, @emergency commands
- **NO LOOPHOLES** - All rules are unbreakable
- **ASK FIRST** - Always ask before making ANY changes

### **🚫 MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECK (CURSOR TOOL LEVEL ENFORCEMENT)**
**This check MUST run before ANY tool execution that modifies code.**

Before ANY code modification action:
1. **Run Pre-Execution Check Script** - Execute `node .ai-compliance-functions/pre-execution-check.js "<task description>"` 
   - Script checks for existing code that can accomplish the task
   - Script validates against function-registry.json
   - Script estimates change size
   
2. **Parse Check Output** - Read the JSON output between `===PRE-EXECUTION-CHECK===` and `===END-PRE-CHECK===` delimiters
   - Status: `PASS` = proceed, `WARN` = show warnings, `BLOCK` = STOP
   - Existing code: Review listed files before creating new code
   - Violations: Fix violations before proceeding
   
3. **If Status = BLOCK:**
   - **STOP** immediately - Do NOT execute any modification tools
   - Report violations to user
   - Wait for user decision before proceeding
   
4. **If Status = WARN:**
   - Show warnings (existing code found, etc.)
   - Ask user for confirmation to proceed
   - Wait for confirmation before proceeding
   
5. **If Status = PASS:**
   - Proceed with caution
   - Use existing code if found (extend, don't rebuild)
   - Make minimal changes (only what's needed)

**ENFORCEMENT:** This pre-check must pass BEFORE any `search_replace`, `write_file`, or other modification tools execute. Exit code 1 = BLOCK, exit code 0 = PASS.

### **🔐 HARD BLOCK SYSTEM**
- **NEVER replace entire files** - Only modify specific lines
- **NEVER delete existing functionality** - Only add or modify
- **NEVER rebuild working code** - Only incremental changes
- **MAXIMUM 100 lines** of code changes per request (matches modular rule)
- **ALWAYS preserve existing work** - Never destroy what exists

### **⚡ RUNTIME ENFORCEMENT**
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if rules are violated
- **ASK FOR EXPLICIT PERMISSION** to continue
- **EXPLAIN WHAT WENT WRONG** and how to fix it
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - Rules cannot be bypassed

### **🔍 MANDATORY POST-EXECUTION CHECK (CURSOR TOOL LEVEL ENFORCEMENT)**
**This check MUST run after ANY tool execution that modifies code.**

After ANY code modification action completes:

1. **Run Post-Execution Check Script** - Execute `node .ai-compliance-functions/post-execution-check.js [modified files]`
   - Script validates actual lines changed (must be ≤ 100 per file)
   - Script checks for registry violations
   - Script detects full file replacements
   - Script detects excessive deletions
   
2. **Parse Check Output** - Read the JSON output between `===POST-EXECUTION-CHECK===` and `===END-POST-CHECK===` delimiters
   - Status: `PASS` = no violations, `VIOLATIONS` = violations found
   - Summary: Total files modified, lines changed, violation counts
   - Violations: List of all violations with severity
   - Fixes: Suggested fixes for each violation
   
3. **If Violations Detected:**
   - **REPORT IMMEDIATELY** to user with:
     - List of all violations (critical, high, medium)
     - Suggested fixes for each
     - Required actions
   - **ASK USER** to choose:
     - Fix violations now
     - Continue as-is (user acknowledges violations)
     - Revert changes
   - **STOP** until user decides
   
4. **If No Violations:**
   - Confirm work completed successfully
   - Summarize what was changed
   - Continue with workflow

**ENFORCEMENT:** This post-check must run AFTER any code modification tools complete. Violations must be reported to user before continuing. Exit code 1 = violations found, exit code 0 = pass.

## 📋 **CORE RULES ENFORCEMENT**

### **📋 MANDATORY CHECKS**
1. **Registry Check** - Check `function-registry.json` before modifying ANY file
2. **Progress Check** - Ensure action matches current focus
3. **Incremental Check** - Don't rebuild existing working code
4. **Standards Check** - Follow all development standards

### **🔒 HARD BLOCKS**
- ❌ **Completed Functions** - Cannot touch functions marked as "completed"
- ❌ **Non-Incremental Actions** - Cannot rebuild existing working code
- ❌ **Registry Violations** - Must check registry before any action
- ❌ **Standards Violations** - Must follow all development standards

### **✅ ALLOWED PATTERNS**
- ✅ Incremental improvements
- ✅ New feature development
- ✅ Bug fixes and optimizations
- ✅ Following established patterns
- ✅ Using shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Following development standards

### **🚫 AVOID PATTERNS**
- ❌ Rebuilding existing working code
- ❌ Replacing entire files
- ❌ Deleting existing functionality
- ❌ Making assumptions about what user wants
- ❌ Working on multiple files simultaneously
- ❌ Bypassing registry checks
- ❌ **LOOP PREVENTION RULE** - **HARDCODED**: If same issue not fixed after 2 tries, on 3rd attempt:
  - **STOP** and reconsider the solution
  - **ANALYZE** what did work in previous attempts
  - **IDENTIFY** the root cause of failure
  - **PROPOSE** a completely different approach
  - **ASK** user for permission to try new approach
  - **MOVE ON** if no clear solution after 3 attempts
  - **LOG** the failure and what was attempted

## 🎯 **ENHANCED GUARD RAILS WITH DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS**

### **📋 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS RULES**
All code must follow these standards without exception:

### **🔧 REACT STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT**
- ✅ PascalCase file naming (UserProfile.tsx)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for props
- ✅ Hooks at top level of components
- ✅ Proper import order (React -> external -> internal -> assets)
- ✅ Named exports for components, default exports for pages
- ✅ Proper component structure and organization

### **🎨 TAILWIND STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT**
- ✅ Use utility classes directly
- ✅ Avoid @apply in global CSS
- ✅ Avoid arbitrary values, use theme values
- ✅ Avoid inline styles, use Tailwind utilities
- ✅ Use cva (Class Variance Authority) for component variants
- ✅ Proper className organization and readability

### **⚡ NEXT.JS STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT**
- ✅ 'use client' directive for client components
- ✅ Proper import order and organization
- ✅ Server Components for data fetching
- ✅ Client Components for interactivity
- ✅ Proper file structure (app/ directory)
- ✅ Server Actions for mutations

### **🔐 SUPABASE STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT**
- ✅ Use @supabase/ssr package exclusively
- ✅ Use getAll() and setAll() methods only
- ✅ Never use individual cookie methods (get/set/remove)
- ✅ Never use @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
- ✅ Always return supabaseResponse in middleware
- ✅ Always call auth.getUser() in middleware
- ✅ Proper browser and server client implementations

### **🎨 SHADCN/UI STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT**
- ✅ Always use shadcn/ui components when available
- ✅ Import from `@/components/ui/[component]`
- ✅ Use proper shadcn component names and props
- ✅ Follow shadcn component patterns and structure
- ✅ Never create custom implementations of shadcn components
- ✅ Never reinvent shadcn functionality
- ✅ Never use custom styling when shadcn provides the component
- ✅ Use full shadcn implementation with all features

## 🔧 **REFACTORING RULES**

### **MODULAR BUILD PATTERN**
For every 100 lines examined, follow this hierarchy:
- **Page = Parent** (e.g., bork-api page)
- **Tab = Child** (e.g., connection-test tab)
- **Component = Child of Child** (e.g., SimpleApiTest component)
- **Sibling Tabs** = Independent children
- **Test each level** before moving to next

### **TESTING STRATEGY**
1. **Test Parent** - Ensure page structure works
2. **Test Children** - Ensure tabs function correctly
3. **Test Grandchildren** - Ensure components work within tabs
4. **Test Siblings** - Ensure independent tabs don't interfere
5. **Test Integration** - Ensure all levels work together

## 📊 **MONITORING & LOGGING**

### **🎯 INTEGRATION POINTS**
- **Function Registry** - Track completed functions
- **Progress Log** - Track current focus
- **AI Tracking** - Track all actions and violations
- **User Feedback** - Track user satisfaction

### **📊 SUCCESS METRICS**
- User doesn't have to repeat requests
- Functions marked as "completed" stay untouched
- Changes are minimal and targeted
- No existing functionality is destroyed
- User knows exactly what will be changed before it happens
- Code follows all development standards
- Modular testing pattern is followed

### **🔧 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**
1. **Load all tracking files** before any action
2. **Validate against all rules** before proceeding
3. **Ask for clarification** if anything is unclear
4. **Show proposed changes** before applying
5. **Log all actions** for audit trail
6. **Monitor for violations** and stop immediately

### **🤖 AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE INTEGRATION**
The compliance system automatically:
- **Monitors file changes** and runs compliance checks
- **Prevents rule violations** before they happen
- **Updates tracking files** automatically
- **Logs all actions** for audit trail

---

**Status**: 🛡️ **UNBREAKABLE RULES ACTIVE**  
**Mode**: DEFENSIVE ONLY  
**Overrides**: NONE ALLOWED  
**Loop Prevention**: HARDCODED - 3 attempts max per issue  
**Ready for**: Safe, incremental development

---

## 🤖 Approved Chat Models (Single Defensive Mode)
- GPT‑5: Default for all code changes; minimal, additive edits only.
- Sonnet 4.5: Planning/scoping, affected files, explicit approvals.
- Haiku 4.5: Post‑edit checks, summaries, compliance confirmations.
- GPT‑5 Codex (optional): Speedy code‑gen for strictly additive changes, off by default.

Policy: One mode only (DEFENSIVE). One model per task; escalate only if blocked.

### 🔁 Model Workflow + Post-Change Verification
- Plan (Sonnet 4.5): scope, affected files, tiny-diff plan; ask before edits.
- Implement (GPT-5, Defensive): apply approved minimal edits only.
- Check & Clean (Haiku 4.5): summarize diffs, ensure scope adherence.
- Verify (Gate, mandatory):
  - Typecheck/lint/build pass with zero new warnings.
  - Only approved files changed; no unrelated edits.
  - Affected routes/pages load; APIs return 2xx.
  - Rollback if any unrelated breakage or scope drift is detected.

### 🪵 Branch & Merge Policy (DEFENSIVE)
- Branches:
  - main: protected, release‑only
  - development: integration target
  - feature/<scope>: per task, from development
  - concept: prototype only (never merges directly)
- Merge to development requires all items in "Verify (Gate)" above.
- Stalled branches: if no commits for 3 days, system prompts to either finish/merge, rebase and continue, or park as on‑hold.
- Open branches guard: if >5 feature branches exist, system asks to prioritize merges before opening a new one.
- Keywords to merge (explicit approval required): "merge to dev", "promote to development", "mark done and merge".

### 🔐 Hard Enforcement Checks at Cursor Tool Level (Cannot Bypass)

**PRE-EXECUTION GATE (Blocks tool execution):**
Before any tool that modifies code (`search_replace`, `write_file`, etc.):
1) **Pre-Execution Check** - Run `node .ai-compliance-functions/pre-execution-check.js "<task>"` and parse JSON output
2) **Registry Check** - Verify function not marked "completed" + "do not touch"  
3) **Size Check** - Verify planned changes ≤ 100 lines (estimated)
4) **Existing Code Check** - Use existing code if found, don't rebuild
5) **Status Validation** - If status = BLOCK → **BLOCK tool execution** → Report to user → Wait for approval
6) **Mode Check** - Verify DEFENSIVE mode active

**POST-EXECUTION GATE (Reports violations):**
After any tool that modifies code completes:
1) **Post-Execution Check** - Run `node .ai-compliance-functions/post-execution-check.js [files]` and parse JSON output
2) **Size Violation Check** - Count actual lines changed (must be ≤ 100 per file)
3) **Code Reuse Check** - Verify existing code was used when possible
4) **Preservation Check** - Verify no existing functionality was deleted
5) **Registry Violation Check** - Verify no completed functions were modified
6) **Violation Reporting** - If violations detected → **Report to user immediately** → Suggest fixes → Wait for user decision

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:**
- Pre/post-check scripts are implemented and available
- Enforcement relies on AI compliance (scripts must be run manually)
- True tool-level enforcement would require Cursor/VSCode extension (not yet implemented)
- Scripts output structured JSON that AI must parse and act on

**WORKFLOW:**
1. User requests code change
2. AI runs pre-execution-check.js → Parses output → Acts on status
3. AI executes code modification tools (if pre-check passed)
4. AI runs post-execution-check.js → Parses output → Reports violations
5. AI waits for user decision if violations found

If any check fails, assistant MUST NOT proceed and MUST ask for guidance.
