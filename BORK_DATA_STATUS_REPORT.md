2. **Gap 2:** 2025-01-30 to 2025-02-16 (16 missing days)

**Total Missing Days:** 47 days

## Processing Status Analysis

### Raw Data Processing
- ‚úÖ **Raw data exists** for 3 locations
- ‚úÖ **Raw data appears to be processed** (1,000 raw records = 1,000 processed records)
- ‚ùå **Processing is incomplete** - many dates missing processed records

### Data Quality Issues
- **Processing Logic Problem:** The system shows equal raw and processed record counts, but many dates are missing processed data
- **This suggests:** Raw data is being processed, but not all dates are being converted to individual sales records

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues
1. **Incomplete Processing Pipeline:** Raw data exists but processing to individual sales records is failing
2. **Date Mapping Issues:** Raw data dates are not being properly mapped to processed data dates
3. **Database Performance:** Connection timeouts suggest database performance issues
4. **Missing Data Sync:** "All HNHG Locations" has no data at all

### Technical Issues
- Database connection timeouts (Error 522)
- Query performance problems with large datasets
- Potential RLS (Row Level Security) policy issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Fix Processing Pipeline**
   - Investigate why raw data dates are not being converted to processed data dates
   - Check the `process-bork-raw-data` function for bugs
   - Verify date mapping logic in the processing functions

2. **Resolve Database Issues**
   - Address connection timeout problems
   - Optimize database queries
   - Check RLS policies for data access issues

3. **Complete Missing Data Sync**
   - Sync data for "All HNHG Locations"
   - Fill in the 47 missing days across all locations

### Medium Priority Actions
1. **Data Validation**
   - Implement data quality checks
   - Add monitoring for processing completeness
   - Create alerts for failed processing

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add proper indexing

### Long-term Actions
1. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up automated monitoring for data processing
   - Create dashboards for data completeness
   - Implement automated retry mechanisms

2. **Data Governance**
   - Establish data quality standards
   - Create data validation rules
   - Implement data lineage tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix the processing pipeline to ensure all raw data dates are converted to processed data
2. **Short-term:** Resolve database performance issues
3. **Medium-term:** Implement comprehensive data validation and monitoring
4. **Long-term:** Establish robust data governance practices

## Conclusion

The Bork data processing system requires immediate attention. While raw data is being collected successfully, the processing pipeline is not converting all raw data to individual sales records. This results in incomplete data coverage and potential business impact. Priority should be given to fixing the processing logic and resolving database performance issues.
